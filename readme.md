# Caffe models of network in LocNet

<img src="https://github.com/ZJUYH/LocNet_caffe/blob/master/image/network.png" width= 1000>

The implementation of LocNet back-end is based on `caffe`, and this page contains the caffe models of LocNet network.

In the `models` folder, for example, `kitti_delta_range` means that this model is used in KITTI dataset with Velodyne HDL-64E, with the Î”-r representations.
The input of the network is the image-like representations of LiDAR data, which can be generated using [LocNet_frontend](https://github.com/ZJUYH/LocNet_frontend).

If you use our implementation in your work, please cite the following paper:
